* After installation, you can start the application by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

  - This will launch the application, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## **_Architecture_**

### Project Architecture Overview

The **`Marhaba Delivery Service`** Application with Authentication follows a modern and scalable architectural approach to ensure efficient delivery operations and enhanced user experiences. The project's architecture can be described as a client-server architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and the backend components.

**Frontend :**

- The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It offers a responsive and visually appealing user experience. React Router is used for managing client-side routing within the application.

**Backend :**

- The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a reliable and performant server for handling user authentication, user management, and communication with the database. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure user authentication.

**Database :**

- The project uses a database system (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or others) to store user information and order data. The backend interacts with the database to manage and retrieve this information.

**Docker Containers :**

- The application components, both frontend and backend, are containerized using Docker. This approach simplifies deployment, enhances scalability, and ensures consistent behavior across different environments.

> *The client and server components communicate via API calls, and the architecture is designed to be modular and extensible to accommodate future enhancements and integrations.*

## **_Authentication_**

### User Authentication and Security

User authentication is a critical component of the **`Marhaba Delivery Service`** Application, ensuring secure access to user accounts and delivery services. Here's how authentication is implemented:

**User Registration :**

- Users can create accounts by providing their name, email, and password. Client-side validation ensures data accuracy. When a user registers, their information is securely stored in the database.

**User Login :**

- Registered users can securely log in using their email and password. The backend verifies the provided credentials and, upon successful authentication, issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) to the user.

**JWT Tokens :**

- JWT tokens are used to authenticate users for subsequent requests. These tokens are securely stored on the client-side and sent with each request to the server for validation. This mechanism ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

**Password Reset :**

- In case users forget their passwords, a password reset feature is available. Users can initiate the process by providing their email address. The backend generates a secure password reset link and sends it to the user via email.

**User Logout :**

- Users can securely log out by simply clicking a logout button. This action clears the JWT token from the client-side, effectively ending the user's session.

**Security Measures :**

- The application incorporates robust security measures, including input validation, protection against common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and adherence to best practices in secure coding.

## **_Deployment_**

### Dockerized Deployment

The **`Marhaba Delivery Service`** Application is deployed using Docker containers, which offers several advantages:

**Containerization :**

- Both the frontend and backend components are containerized, allowing them to run consistently in various environments without dependency issues.

**Simplified Deployment :**

- Docker containers simplify the deployment process. The application can be deployed on any system that supports Docker, ensuring a seamless setup.

**Scalability :**

- Docker containers are scalable, making it easy to accommodate increased workloads or future growth in the user base.

**Orchestration :**

- Docker Compose is used for orchestrating multiple containers, enabling easy communication between the frontend and backend.

**Network Isolation :**

- Containers provide network isolation, enhancing security and ensuring that the application components interact in a controlled and secure manner.

> *The use of Docker and Docker Compose simplifies the deployment process, enhances maintainability, and provides an efficient way to manage the `Marhaba Delivery Service` Application.*

## **_Performance_**

### Optimizing Application Performance

Performance optimization is a key focus of the **`Marhaba Delivery Service`** Application to ensure that users experience smooth and responsive interactions. Here are some of the measures taken to optimize performance:

**Frontend Performance :**

- The frontend is built using React, which is known for its efficient rendering. The application minimizes unnecessary re-renders and utilizes memoization techniques to enhance overall performance.

**API Caching :**

- Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce the load on the server and improve response times. This ensures that users receive data faster and with minimal latency.

**Load Testing :**

- The application undergoes rigorous load testing to identify performance bottlenecks. Performance testing is conducted under various scenarios to assess its ability to handle high concurrent user loads.

**Optimized Asset Delivery :**

- Static assets are delivered using content delivery networks (CDNs) to reduce latency and improve load times.

**Database Indexing:**

- The database is optimized with proper indexing to speed up data retrieval, particularly for frequently accessed data.

> These performance optimization strategies are implemented to deliver a responsive and efficient `Marhaba Delivery Service` Application, even under heavy workloads.

## **_Security_**

### Ensuring Application Security

Security is a top priority in the `Marhaba Delivery Service` Application to protect user data and the integrity of the delivery process. Key security measures include:

**Authentication :**

- Robust user authentication using JWT tokens to ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources.

**Data Validation :**

- Extensive input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Secure Password Reset :**

- The password reset process is protected by secure token generation and delivery via email, ensuring that only the user can initiate a password reset.

**Session Management :**

- Effective session management to prevent unauthorized access or session hijacking.

**Protection Against CSRF :**

- Implementing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent malicious requests from attackers.

**Regular Security Audits :**

- Ongoing security audits and code reviews to identify and address potential security issues.

**Data Encryption :**

- Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, adding an extra layer of security.

> *These security measures are implemented to safeguard user data and ensure a secure delivery experience for all users of the `Marhaba Delivery Service` Application.*
